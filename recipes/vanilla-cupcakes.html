    <p>If you are a fan of Chai tea and Chai lattes, this is a way to incorporate those flavors into your sweets.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>⅔ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>¾ cup superfine sugar</li> 
        <li>1 ½ cups self-rising flour</li> 
        <li>3 eggs</li> 
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li> 
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12 cup muffin pan or line with paper baking cups.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Stir in the eggs, one at a time, blending well after each one. Stir in the vanilla and flour just until mixed. Spoon the batter into the prepared cups, dividing evenly.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pan set over a wire rack. When cool, arrange the cupcakes on a serving platter.</li>
    </ol>
