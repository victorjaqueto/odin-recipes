    <h1>Vegan Cupcakes</h1>

    <p>These taste amazing and are quick to make! You can play around and substitute different milks, oils and extracts; just about any will work. I've listed my favorites. Unfortunately, this recipe doesn't rise well as a cake, but cupcakes are more fun anyway! These are great with a simple frosting of cocoa powder, powdered sugar and orange juice.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups almond milk</li> 
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li> 
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li> 

        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li> 
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li> 
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li> 
        <li>½ cup coconut oil, warmed until liquid</li> 
        <li>1 ¼ teaspoons vanilla extract</li> 
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 12 cup muffin pans or line with 18 paper baking cups.</li>
        <li>Measure the apple cider vinegar into a 2 cup measuring cup. Fill with almond milk to make 1 1/2 cups. Let stand until curdled, about 5 minutes. In a large bowl, Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the almond milk mixture, coconut oil and vanilla. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir just until blended. Spoon the batter into the prepared cups, dividing evenly.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pan set over a wire rack. When cool, arrange the cupcakes on a serving platter. Frost with desired frosting.</li>
